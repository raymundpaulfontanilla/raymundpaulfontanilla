Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Raymund Paul S. Fontanilla an Information Security Enthusiasts, who can try to learn the fundamentals of  web development with secure coding, to make a secure application in each company in the Philippines to protect their Personal Identifiable Information(PII).

I want to help end-users especially in the Philippines, because Philippines is one of the country who has lack in Information Security awareness.

My Motto is......

"Work to learn, don't work for money"

My Weakness is almost the same of Bill Gates which is.....

"I don't want my brain to stop working"

Hobbies:

* Playing Single Open Worlld RPG like Assassin's Creed, Watchdogs, Prince of Persia etc...
* Watching Series, Movies and Documentary with IT related.
* Watching Series, Movies and Documentary with Non IT related.
* Watching Anime
